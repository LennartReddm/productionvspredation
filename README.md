A google colab notebook containing the equilibrium analyses of the Attacker-Defender Contest (AD-C) and Production Attacker-Defender Contest (PAD-C) for a forthcoming paper about predation vs production dynamics. 

We use the Lemke-Howson algorithm (Lemke & Howson, 1964) to calculate equilibria for AD-C and PAD-C and map the space of equilibrium predictions for the PAD-C as a function of two parameters - the production threshold T and production payoff k. The notebook includes the mixed equilibrium probability distributions, strategy averages for multiple variables, and figures.
