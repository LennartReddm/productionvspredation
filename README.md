This repository contains the equilibrium and behavioral data analyses of the Attacker-Defender Contest (AD-C) and Production Attacker-Defender Contest (PAD-C) for a forthcoming paper about predation vs production dynamics. 

_Equilibrium_Analysis_Production_vs_Predation_

In this notebook, we use the Lemke-Howson algorithm (Lemke & Howson, 1964) to calculate game-theoretic equilibria for AD-C and PAD-C and map the space of equilibrium predictions for the PAD-C as a function of two parameters - the production threshold T and production payoff k. The notebook includes the mixed equilibrium probability distributions, strategy averages for multiple variables, and figures.

_Behavioral_Analysis_Production_vs_Predation_

This notebook includes Figure 4 of the paper, a combined plot displaying behavioral data and game-theoretic equilibrium benchmarks for key variables. The notebook also contains random intercept regression models used for the analysis reported in the paper.
